## Interior Designer 

[View the live project here.](https://tnamdarian.github.io/saranamdarian) 

This is a full-fledge website for an interior designer based in Vancouver, Canada. The website features ‘about the designer’, 'ethos''call for action', ‘testimonials’, ‘the designer’s portfolio’, ‘consultation process’, ‘contact form’, 'designer's contact details' and ‘social media links’. The objective of this projects is to generate leads for the business through the contact page. 

As interior design is a long and costly process, it will take time for new clients to make informed decisions about the designer they would like to hire. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information, showcase the designers’ portfolio, and share the previous clients’ testimonials to build trust with potential clients. A realistic project timeline is also communicated with users on the contact page to show various stages of the consultation process from the beginning to the completion of a project. 

The business goals of this website are:
* Increase brand awareness.
* Reach wider clients by showcasing the designers’ portfolio.
* Generate leads (via the contact page).
* Simple and straightforward UX design close to the definer’s’ concept i.e. simplicity. 
* Create realistic expectations of the design process and establish smooth designer-client relationship. 

The customer visit this website to:
* Search for a reliable and skillful interior designer to enhance their living and/or working environments. 
* Have enough compelling and convincing evidence that this designer is the right fit for their project. 
* Find the contact information effortlessly by filling up a form to hire the designer. 
* Understand how the design process works and what the time scale is. 

# UX
Most designer websites increase the cognitive load on the user which might make the users feel intimidated or overwhelmed. My aim was to create a simple website where the information is accessible effortlessly. Deciding to renovate living or working spaces is a difficult task; it is time-consuming, complex and expensive. Therefore, people might delay it until they can find someone who they can rely on. I want the design and content of the website to make this decision making process easier for potencial clients. 

### Ideal client 
The ideal client for this business is: 
* English speaking
* Values design 
* Located in Vancouver, Canada
* Home or/and business owners 
* Willing to spend money on a design or concept to modernize/enhance their domestic or commercial spaces. 

The project help clients to: 
* navigate easily through the website and reach the information they need easily. 
* get to know the designer, previous clients, and her works and to contact her directly.

## Surface 
The logo and a callapsing menu bar are centred in the header incorporating black and white colours to represent a sleek and modern feel in keeping with the brand. This colour coordination is seen throughout the body of the website with dark typography to represent a minimalist yet bold styles.  The designer has chosen green colour for specific features such as hover over the menu items, call to action buttons, and social media icons to represent the sustainability in her designs. The combination of natural and green colours convey a sense of creativity and confidence which reflects the designer’s personality. I also tried to use bold typography to further promote confidence and creativity as a reflection of the industry. 

# Features 
### Header
The website consists of three pages; Home, Work and Contact. The **header** contains a **logo** and **menu** option on the top middle of every page.  This will create consistency throughout the page and the user can access the information via the menu bar and move around the site. The links will remain active when in use. 

### Footer
Every page has a **footer** with **desginer's address**, **designer's phone number**, **social media and email icons** and **copyright information**. The social media icons are linked to the users’ social media accounts. 
There is also a **Top** button which with one click it takes the user to the menu bar. 

### Home
The Home page features an **image of the designer** to personalise the website and raise brand awareness. To the left side of the image, there is some information about the designer to make the users feel connected to the brand. 
At the bottom of these, the **designer’s’ visions and ethos** are presented. This helps the users to be able to make an informed decision whether they share the same values as the designer with regards to design concepts. It will enhance user’s emotional response. 
Finally, there is an invitation to have a chat about the user’s project via a **call to action** button: *Book your free consultation session now!*. 
The Home page also has **four parallax featuers** to separate each section and create positive user response. These features will turn into images which scroll up and down with the rest of the page for iPads and phones. 

### Work
The Work page features **images in thumbnails** in 4 columns wide for laptop and desktop devices, 2 for iPads and 1 column wide for mobile devices.
Each image can be clicked to open a **fancybox** window to view further images/details of each project. 
The **testimonials** are placed below the project works to build trust and credibility and accountability of the designer. 
At the bottom of the page, there is an invitation to have a chat about the user’s project via a **call to action** button: *Book your free consultation session now!*. 
The Work page also has **two parallax featuers** to separate each section and create positive user response. These features will turn into images which scroll up and down with the rest of the page for iPads and phones.

# Features to Implement in future
Due to time restraints, I was unable to include the following features but hope to implement them in a future release:
* Embed up-to-date social media feeds - To showcase promotional activity and create buzz for the client base.
* Promotional video on the homepage – To make the homepage more appealing and engaging and create a more positive emotional response to the user. There was no promotional video available as this stage. 
* Designer’s blog to share educational articles and guides for added value. The designer has not had time to create a blog yet.  
* Live Chat app - To provide an instant connection between the user and company with high visibility on the site. I do not have the skills yet. 
* Add CAPTCHA to contact form – Allows business to protect the contact form from spam.  – Javascript Needed.
* FAQ page, table with FAQs and dropdown buttons to view answers - Helps potential clients find answers to their common questions. (The designer has to compile and provide a list in the future.)
* Option to choose the language of the website - As the artist's second language is Farsi, this would allow Farsi speaking visitors to the website who form a big population in Vancouver, to view it in their native language. The content was not ready at this stage.
* Add a download button for a white paper for digital marketing purposes and building an email list in the future. The content was not ready at this stage.

# Acknowledgement 
I decided to develop this website for my sister as she wanted to have a brand new website which has a more modern feel to it and it also reflected her own style and character. I took aspiration for this site from the following websites in terms of design: 
* [Karimrashid.com]( http://karimrashid.com/)
* [Avissa Design]( https://avissadesign.com/press)
* [sokruta.com.ua/en](https://sokruta.com.ua/en)
* I also received inspirations for the content of the website for personal branding via [Interior Design Business: How To Build a Personal Brand](https://essenziale-hd.com/2017/10/02/interior-design-business-build-personal-brand/).
* [Bootsnip.com](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/g5XDo#comments) I was inspired by the code on this snippet which was written in Bootsnip 3.1.0. I used Bootstrap5 to create a similar laypit for the website's header and menubar.
