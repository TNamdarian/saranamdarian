## Interior Designer 

[View the live project here.]() 

This is a full-fledge website for an interior designer based in Vancouver, Canada. The website features ‘about the designer’, ‘testimonials’, ‘the designer’s portfolio’, ‘consultation process’, ‘contact form’, and ‘social media links’. The objective of this projects is to generate leads for the business through the contact page. 

As interior design is a long and costly process, it will take time for new clients to make informed decisions about the designer they would like to hire. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information, showcase the designers’ portfolio, and share the previous clients’ testimonials to build trust with potential clients. A realistic scope is also communicated with users on the contact page to show various stages of the consultation process from the beginning to the completion of a project. 

The business goals of this website are:
* increase brand awareness.
* reach wider clients by showcasing the designers’ portfolio.
* Generate leads (via the contact page).
* Simple and straightforward UX design close to the definer’s’ concept. 
* Create realistic expectations of the design process and establish smooth designer-client relationship. 

The customer goals of this website are:
* Searching for a reliable and skillful interior designer to enhance their living and working environments. 
* Having enough compelling and convincing evidence that this designer is the right fit for their project. 
* finding the contact information effortlessly to fill up the form to hire the designer. 
* Understanding how the design process works and what the time scale is. 

# UX
Most designer websites increase the cognitive load on the user. They might feel intimidated or overwhelmed by it. My aim was to create a simple website where the information is accessible effortlessly. Deciding to renovate living or working spaces is a difficult task. It is time-consuming, complex and expensive. Therefore, people might delay it until they can find someone who can rely on. I want the design and content of the website to make this decision making process easier for the users. 


Useable, and useful! Valuable to the organization. 


Function! Intuitive, user centred design, positive emotional expertise, users enjoy the product, rise above the noise, fit mu needs? Do I like this place? Positive reactions? Sales? Conversion? Increase traffic. 


Strategy plane: What are you trying to achieve? for whom? B2B as it is not line B2C driven by emotional triggers and impulse buying. It needs a certain amount of budget to commit to the project. It needs research and planning in advance. The website needs to provide enough information and calls-to-action including emails, phone number, business address, to create a great sense of reliability and assurance. It also needs have a lot of types of content, video tutorials, white papers, blogs, FQAs and webinars. 
Scope plan: what's on the table? 
How is the information structured? 
Skeleton: How to navigate? 
Surface: how does the finished product look like? There are so many iss

## Surface 
The logo on the left side and the menu of the right side of the header incorporates black and white colours to represent a sleek and modern feel in keeping with the brand. This colour coordination is seen throughout the body of the website with dark typography to represent a minimalist yet bold styles.  The designer has chosen green colour for specific features such as hover over the call to action buttons and menu items to represent the sustainability in her designs. The combination of natural and green colours convey a sense of creativity and confidence which reflects the designer’s personality. I also tried to use bold typography to further promote confidence and creativity as a reflection of the industry. 
# Features 
The website consists of three pages; home, portfolio and contact. The **header** contains a **logo** on the top left and **menu** option on the top right of every page.

* FAQ page, table with FAQs and dropdown buttons to view answers - Gives potential clients easy to find answers to their common questions. (The designer has to compile and provide a list in the future.)
* Option to choose the language of the website - As the artist's second language is Farsi, this would allow Farsi speaking visitors to the website who form a big population in Vancouver so that they can view it in their native language.  (the content was not ready at this stage).
